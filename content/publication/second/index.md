abstract: Recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) experience a substantial health care burden, with potentially differing patterns of long-term health care requirements using peripheral blood stem cells, bone marrow, and umbilical cord blood (UCB) grafts. We analyzed data from 1077 consecutive adult allogeneic HCT recipients who underwent transplant at the University of Minnesota between 2000 and 2016. To estimate health care burden over time, we compared the number of visits, laboratory studies, medications, and relative value units billed. Health care elements were analyzed both individually and together (ie, total health care elements used per patient days into a density composite score). UCB had the lowest density health care burden composite score from the time of transplant through year 5 (median score 64.0 vs 70.5 for peripheral blood stem cells and 88.0 for bone marrow; P < .01). In multivariate analysis of health care burden between years 1 and 5, recipients of either bone marrow (odds ratio [OR] 0.49 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29-0.84]) or peripheral blood stem cells (OR 0.49 [95% CI 0.36-0.67]) were half as likely to experience low health care burden compared with UCB. Adult recipients of UCB have a lower long-term health care burden compared with other graft sources, possibly reflecting a better quality of life.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Healthcare burden varies by graft source with favorable outcomes in long-term survivors after UCBT compared recipients of BM and PBSC.
