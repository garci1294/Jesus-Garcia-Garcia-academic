¡Hola! Bienvenid@s a mi pagina.

My name is Jesus and I am a computational biology Ph.D. graduate student at the University of Minnesota. I am very fortunate to be co-advised by Dr. Andrew Venteicher and Dr. Jinhua Wang.

I have a deep interest in studying brain tumors at the genomic level. The brain is a very complex system, and cancer adds to its complexity. Genomic computational algorithms are becoming more dynamic and I am optimistic that involving these computational techniques will help us better understand the brain.

In lab I exercise high-performance computing using LINUX heterogeneous clusters; design and implement computational biology tools to analyze different genomic technologies' results with the primary goal of classifying vulnerabilities in brain tumorigenesis.

Quick background about myself, I am originally from Distrito Federal, Mexico, and came to the United States at the age of 7. Currently, I am a DACA recipient working towards my dreams of becoming a doctor in the computational biology field.
